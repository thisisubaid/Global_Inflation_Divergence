# Global Inflation Divergence: A Post-COVID Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes how inflation trends diverged across countries after COVID-19 (2020–2024) and examines economic resilience using GDP per capita, exchange rates, and recovery categories.

## Business Problem
Post-COVID inflation affected countries unevenly. Policymakers, investors, and businesses need to understand which economies recovered faster and why.
